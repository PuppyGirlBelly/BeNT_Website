	<h2>Mad Scientists and Musicians creating <em>"Better Noise Toys"</em>!</h2>

	<p>
		Better Noise Toys (AKA: BeNT) is a collective and partnership based around musicians who want
		new toys. Not just the same clones of Tube Screamers, Telecasters, or Moog Synths that everybody
		else creates. So we create items that speak to us that don't exist already and speak to us
		creatively. And we want to enable others to be creative as well! So we provide schematics,
		jumpers, and headers to help others take what we have created and turn it into brand new items
		as well!
	</p>

	<h2>Who We Are</h2>
	<p>
		Currently we'll be keeping ourselves private and nameless, but the team is founded by three
		women and non-binary folk;
