Welcome to _Better Noise Toys_, the newest partnership in the Music Industry. We
seek to create items that nobody else does; and items that enable __you__ to
create new sounds using our toys.

We also believe that we can not and should not tell you what sounds best, or how
to use our toys once they're in your hands. So we provide jumpers, headers, and
schematics with our products as well as using standard off-the-shelf components
when we can to help make it easy for you to modify, configure, and repair the
toys you buy, build, and own.
